Not just an Universal MediaCreationTool wrapper script with ingenious support for business editions,  
<img src="preview.png">
A powerful yet simple windows 10 / 11 deployment automation tool as well!  

> configure via set vars, commandline parameters or rename script like `iso 21H2 Pro MediaCreationTool.bat`  
> recommended windows setup options with the least amount of issues on upgrades set via auto.cmd  
> awesome dialogs with keyboard focus to pick target version and preset action  

> **Auto Setup** with detected media without confirmation  
> _- can troubleshoot upgrade failing by adding `no_update` to script name_  
> **Create ISO** with detected media in `C:\ESD` folder without confirmation  
> _- can override detected media by adding edition name / language / arch to script name_  
> **Create USB** with detected media after confirmation  
> _- can click Back and select ISO instead to save in a different path_  
> custom presets above support 'oem' media customization, that can be disabled by adding `no_oem` to script name  
> _- pickup `$OEM$` folder (if it exists) with any post setup tweaks like `$OEM$\$$\Setup\Scripts\setupcomplete.cmd`_  
> _- write `sources\PID.txt` file to preselect edition at media boot or setup within windows (if configured)_  
> _- write `auto.cmd` file to re-run auto setup on demand, from media (includes Skip TPM if sources are 11)_  
> _- write `winpeshl.ini` file in boot.wim to Skip TPM Check on media boot (if sources are 11)_  
> **Select in MCT** with manual confirmation for everything in MCT GUI  
> _- no 'oem' media customization, script passes products.xml configuration and quits without touching media_  

> Skip TPM Check on Dynamic Update v1 _(wmi-based)_ or v2 _(ifeo-based)_ standalone toggle scripts in `MCT\` dir  
> _- system-wide, unblocks insider previews on windows update, or running setup.exe manually while online_  
> _- when using created media on another pc for the first time, can launch `auto.cmd` from media once to enable_
